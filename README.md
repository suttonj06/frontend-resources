# Frontend-Resources <a name="top"></a>

A collection of all the resources I use to keep up with the latest in front-end web development - Tom McGurl [@Tom_McGurl](https://twitter.com/tom_mcgurl)

Front-end Web Development is rapidly growing and changing. Sometimes it's tough to keep up with all of the libraries and frameworks out there. As a lead javascript developer at my company, I'm often approached by co-workers and friends who are looking to get into front-end development or polish their skills. I decided to make this repo to list all of the great resources I use everyday to keep up to date and to learn about all the awesome things happening on the web!

Inspired by all the [awesome lists on Github](https://github.com/bayandin/awesome-awesomeness) (also see the [Repositories section](#repos))

#Repositories
There are also a ton of Github repos that are great to watch. Some are dedicated to collecting all of the resources for a given topic (these are where I got the inspiration for this). These are amazing ways to find a material on a particular framework or library. Here are some of the ones I use.

## Style and Best Practice Guides
Style guides are a useful way to get everyone on the same page when it comes to code style. Style and best practice guides help make code more standard, readable, and shareable. All of which make code collaboration and onboarding easier. There are plenty of benefits to using a styleguide amongst a team or even for your own benefit.

- [Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)
    + This repo is a Javascript style guide from the folks at Airbnb
    + This guide will help you take advantages of the benefits listed above.
- [Angular-styleguide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide)
    + This is an awesome styleguide for Angular
    + John's styleguide is widely adopted and will get you writing your Angular code in a way that follows best-practice and makes it easier to test, build, and understand.
    + The benefit of this style guide is that, like any styleguide, more adoption means more people writing code in a way that others are already familiar with.
    + Notable mention: [Todd Motto's Angular-styleguide](https://github.com/toddmotto/angularjs-styleguide)
        * This styleguide is very similar to John's, but differs in a few places.
        * Follow whichever one works best for you.
        * Since they are similar enough, you will still get the benefits discussed above.
- [Git-Style-Guide](https://github.com/agis-/git-style-guide)
    + This guide covers popular practices for working with git
    + Getting into open source can be intimidating (I'm still working on it myself). Style guides like this help make contributing to open source via github less intimidating by guiding you on best practices.
    + This guide covers things like branch naming, commits, merging and more

## Things to check out (No particular order)
- [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) <a name="react"></a>
    + Awesome Javascript library from the facebook team
    + Has some great concepts and is a great alternative for any existing view layer in your MVC applicatoin
- [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) and [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) <a name="ajs"></a>
    + Fantastic Javascript framework, and currently the one I use the most
    + Extremely popular and a must-know right now
- [EmberJS](http://emberjs.com/)
    + "A framework for creating ambitious web applications" - emberjs homepage
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and now [io.js](https://iojs.org/) as well! <a name="node"></a>
    + I'm sure almost everyone knows about Node at this point, but iojs is the latest fork of node, and created in the interest of ensureing nodejs's future moving forward.
    + I don't think I can explain it any better than the website lead in
    + A must know for Front-end developers
    + It's javascript that can run on the server!
    + You can use this to run a javscript task runner like Grunt or Gulp (see below) to make you development way more productive
    + See [MEAN Stack](#mean)
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
    +  NPM comes with Nodejs
    +  NPM is amazing.
    +  It is used to manage project dependecies using a little file called package.json
    +  NPM is quickly becoming a core element in front-end web development and in my opinion a driving force for javascripts success
    +  With tools like [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and [SystemJS](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs) you can now use NPM to manage your browser and nodejs dependencies
- Javascript Task Runners
    + You can use task runners to do things like
        * start a server
        * watch for changes in html, css, and js and refresh your browser when you save
        * Pre-process your Sass or Less and generate css
        * Create sprite sheets from images
        * So much more...
    - There are many options, and I've listed some below try them all and choose the one that works best for you/your team
    + [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
        + An awesome javascript task runner that will make you super productive
        * Grunt take a configuration approach in which you configure your tasks using a gruntfile
    + [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)
        * An alternative to Grunt that favors code over configuration files
        * With Gulp you write code that pipes your output into the next process and is easy to grok for those that prefer straight code over a config files
    + See also [Brocolli](https://github.com/broccolijs/broccoli) and [Brunch](http://brunch.io/)
- [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)

## What I'm learning this week
I've decided to add a section covering what topics I'm looking into on a weekly basis. I'm putting it here for now until I move some of this over to a blog.

#### Week of:

-   __January 17__

    It's been quite a while since I've updated this so I apologize. I've been keeping busy though. It's 2016 now and 2015 was a great year for JavaScript. We saw React gain popularity while Angular's popularity waned a bit in the wake of Angular 2. While it looks like Angular 2 is finally upon us, having recently gone beta, we have yet to see how the community will take to it. I'll definitely write more on that as things pan out.

    Over that last few months I've had the opportunity to work on some brilliant apps at work. I was lucky enough to work on our mobile app which is still being written using React Native with Redux. I more recently have been working on another project at work, a responsive web app using React with Redux. Between those two apps and some hack week projects at work I've definitely gotten to dive into Redux a bit more and can say that I'm definitely enjoying it. It's not without its quirks, but it definitely helps me understand my application in a way that other architectures don't.

    In my free time I've been doing something different. I've really started to dig into the [Elm programming language](#elm), and I have to say, I'm really enjoying it! It's been extremely fun (and challenging) learning a new language. Being fully functional, and statically typed, Elm is very different than what I'm used to with JavaScript. That said, those differences seem to be what make it so great. I'm even enjoying writing tests. In fact, Elm makes writing unit tests so easy, that I've actively been practicing TDD while working with it. I’m planning on putting up a tutorial on building a small app with Elm soon. In the meantime if anyone is interested in Elm, the github repo, [awesome-elm](https://github.com/isRuslan/awesome-elm), has some wonderful resources for getting started.

-   __October 4__

    I recently listened to the [Javascript Jabber episode on the Elm language](https://devchat.tv/js-jabber/175-jsj-elm-with-evan-czaplicki-and-richard-feldman) with Evan Czaplicki (The creator) and Richard Feldman. It was an awesome and inciteful episode. Shortly after I was lucky enough that my company was able to bring in Richard Feldman to give a talk on his experience with using [Elm](#elm) for his day to day web app development. I decided to give it a shot and I have really liked it so far.

    At first it took a while to get used to the syntax (and I'm still far from fully understanding or writing it well), but after going through the docs a ton, things are finally starting to come together. The documentation has been fantastic.

    I'm trying it out by building a small application (one that I already started in React). So far it's been going pretty well. The static typing has allowed the compiler to catch any issues, and it makes it really easy to write nice clean code. Once I'm finished with the demo I will be posting it on my github in the form of a tutorial.

    Definitely check out Elm! It has a fantastic architecture and its functional style makes writing code clean and fun! It's also the inspiration for the popular [Redux architecture](#redux).

-   __September 20__

	The new job now has me commuting by train instead of by car. This presents me with some great time to work on some fun projects. I picked up a Macbook air 11" that has worked out great as a travel machine. One of the limitations though is that I am not connected to the internet while I'm on the trian so everything I do has to work offline. So I have a setup that has been working for me which I will describe. I plan on extending this into an actual blog post at some point soon.

	For some background, the app I'm currently working on uses ReactJS as a view layer and AmpersandJS models as the model layer. I'm also writing in ES6 via the Babel transpiler, using webpack, and the webpack dev server. For a UI library I'm using [Materialize](#materialize).

	Okay so the first issue was documentation. I needed a way to view docs offline. For that I use both Dash (an OS X app for offline docs) and [DevDocs.io](DevDocs.io) that I mentioned above.

	Next, I needed a way to make requests for data so that I could model out my stores. For this I used [json-server](#json-server) which is an awsome and easy way to serve up json data.

	Next, it's important that you aren't trying to use a CDN for any of your apps resources, since the request for those files will fail when offline. Instead try to contain everything within the app either via bower or npm.

	All npm and Bower dependencies should be installed prior to trying to work offline. One thing I did was create a seperate project where I install all of the libraries/frameworks I think I will use, and add them to a massive package.json/bower.json. Then, when I need them for one of my apps, I pull them out of that project rather than trying to fetch them from a server.

-   __August 30__

	It's been a while since my last post and I'm happy to say that the break was due to me switching jobs! I've started an exciting and awesome new role that has me working and experimenting with a lot of exciting front-end technology. This past week in particular I've been working on writing my own Yeoman generators. It's been super fun and simple.

	I decided to write a generator to make things easier while I'm working on the React version of my Brew Book application. I found myself spending a lot of time typing out the React Class Components. This led me to create a generator to generate out a React Component Class, it's folder, and corresponding sass file.

	After using Yeoman for so long it was awesome to finally write my own generator. It's super simple since it's just node with ejs for the templating.

	I'm hoping publish one of my generators soon.

-   __July 5__

    This week I've been looking more into [Webpack](#webpack) and [Babel](#babel). I plan on using Webpack for the [ReactJS](#react) version of my BrewBook app. I also think it's time I started writing ES6 so I'll be using Babel as a transpiler. I started reading some great articles on using Webpack with ReactJS and Babel. [Setting Up a Single Page React Web App with React-router and Webpack](http://jmfurlott.com/tutorial-setting-up-a-single-page-react-web-app-with-react-router-and-webpack/) is a great article on getting started with Webpack and the babel-loader.

    I also started [ES6 and Beyond](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/es6%20%26%20beyond) from the awesome [You Don't Know JS series](#ydkjs). It is an amazing resource that really covers the new ES6+ features in depth. I can't wait to start using these features.

-   __June 21__

    This week I published my first two npm packages! I published the modules I was working on last week ([ampfire-collection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ampfire-collection) and [ampfire-model](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ampfire-model)). It was a pretty awesome experience publishing something to npm for the first time. The [npm site](https://www.npmjs.com/) has a great [guide on how to publish a package](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/publishing-npm-packages), so I just followed that. It was a super easy processes. Essentially, you just create a [CommonJS](http://www.commonjs.org/) module and export the API that you want. Then your package.json dictates all of the info for your package, including the name that it is exposed as to consumers of the package. You can even add some *keywords* to your package.json to make it more discoverable on npm. I plan on updated the packages with some tests and even a demo soon. I definitely recommend checking out the guide above and try publishing any libraries you may have created that you think others could benefit from.

-   __June 14__

    This week I've been taking a look at AmpersandJS. It's a nice modular alternative to BackboneJS and I think it will work nicely as the 'store' component to a Flux application. I plan on using Ampersand collections and models as the stores for ReactJS version of BrewBook. Since AmpersandJS Models and Collections emit events just like BackboneJS Models and Collections, they are easy to integrate with a React view layer in a flux application.

    I also started modifying Firebase's [BackboneFire](https://github.com/firebase/backbonefire) library so that will work with AmpersandJS Models and Collections as apposed to Backbone Models and Collections. I'm calling it **[ampfire](https://github.com/tommcgurl/ampfire)**. Right now I have it broken into two parts, ampfire-model and ampfire-collection. I wanted to follow Ampersands modularity. Once I'm done it will be easy to integrate your Ampersand stores with Firebase.

-   __May 17__

    I've fallen a bit behind in updating this post section :/ but I'm going to try and keep it up to date. I've been working recently on a new repo experiment. I have decided to start posting something I've been working on. It's basically my version of the popular TodoMVC. My plan is to make a craft beer catalogging app in a few of the popular frameworks/libraries. I've began posting my first version. It uses the [Ionic Framework](#ionic) which uses Angular. The repo is called [brewbook-ionic](https://github.com/tommcgurl/brewbook-ionic). Next I plan on implementing it in React with Flux.

- __April 19__

    This week I thanks to a friend, I had the opportunity to attend the [April Code Genius](https://genius.engineering/photos/). It was an awesome meetup hosted by the folks at [Genius](http://genius.com/). Jeremey Ashkenas gave an awesome terminator-themed talk on transpilers and how coffeescript compiles to javascript. [James Somers](https://twitter.com/jsomers) from genius gave an awesome and hilarious talk on genius' image annotation feature in their [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/genius-beta/ccaokncpmmjiakalbcfdbfmpcaiddjdn?hl=en-US&utm_source=chrome-ntp-launcher). [Dave DeSandro](https://twitter.com/desandro) gave a really great talk on his carousel library [Flickity](http://flickity.metafizzy.co/) and how physics isn't as intimidating as some think.

    It was a great experience and I'm already signed up to go to the [May Code Genius](http://code.genius.com/) with [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat) the creator of Bootstrap, Bower, and more. It will definitely be a good time.

- __April 12__

    This week I continued to work a bit on the Users-Demo-React-Native. I've also been working with [Ionic](#ionic) a bit again. If you haven't checked out Ionic yet, definitely take some time to give it a look. There is a great [video from ng-conf](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvr11fvCeu4) from the guys at Ionic that shows off some of the awesome stuff you can do with it. I plan on putting a repo up soon with a demo application.

    [The Web Platform Podcast](http://thewebplatform.libsyn.com/) had a great [episode the past week](http://thewebplatform.libsyn.com/39-famous-mobile-performance-mixed-mode) with Steve Newcomb of Famo.us. Steve covered a ton of stuff, including their plans for mixed mode, the future of the company, and much more. Definitely check this episode out.

    Angular Air had a great [episode on testing with Angular](https://plus.google.com/events/cb42tejb88eliamj65o2ogh12qo) with guests, Julie Ralph of Protractor, Andres Dominquez, and Zan Thrash. They discuss, compare, and contrast the different forms of javascript testing.

- __April 5__

    This week I do not have much to update since I was on vacation. During that time however, I managed to start my React-Native User's demo discussed in last week's post. The repo is [Users-Demo-React-Native](https://github.com/tommcgurl/Users-Demo-React-Native). You can read the details of it in last weeks post.

    So far I've managed to complete a good portion of the application. Most of the basic functionality is complete and I hope to finalize the functionality and spruce it up a bit in my next commits. I'm thinking about extending it a bit further than originally planned in order to display the use of Flux and more CRUD operations. So far I'm very pleased with React Native, and it has been really fun to use.

    During my vacation flight to Austin, TX, I read some awesome articles on ES6 and I started looking into the transpiler [Babel](#babel). I plan on using this in future development so that I can begin working with ES2015. It already has support for JSX and React and has plugins for all the major build systems.

    Also, the Codewinds podcast came back finally! I listend to the two most recent episodes. [Episode 14](http://codewinds.com/podcast/014.html) simply covers the reason for the long hiatus. In [Episode 15](http://codewinds.com/podcast/015.html) talks to Michael Jackson and Ryan Florence about ReactJS!

- __March 29__   <a name="react-native-post"></a>

    This past week Facebook released [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/). I decided to try it out and was very impressed. For those that have not heard, React native is a way to build native applications using React and javascript. This does not involve the UIWebview. It instead uses the fact that React is decoupled from the DOM, to allow components to render to native views such as iOS(only platform supported at the moment).

    I followed the 'getting started' guide and the walkthrough for creating a ListView movie application. I was extremely impressed at how easy it was to use. There were a few things that are unique to React Native as expected, but they are easy to pick up once you have some experience with ReactJS. I decided to start a demo repo where I expand upon the movies application. It's called [Users-Demo-React-Native](https://github.com/tommcgurl/Users-Demo-React-Native). I am using the [Random User API](http://randomuser.me) from [@randomapi](https://twitter.com/randomapi) to show a master-detail view of users. I will be posting each commit as a 'step' to making the application.

- __March 22__

    This week I'm taking a look at [Angular 2.0](https://angular.io/). I have yet to catch up on all the ng-conf videos but plan on doing that by the end of the week. Scotch.io posted an article on _[The Best News From ng-Conf 2015](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/the-best-news-from-angulars-ng-conf-2015)_ a few weeks ago that does a great job summarizing the major points from the conference. I got a chance to listen to [Adventures in Angular Episode 34](http://devchat.tv/adventures-in-angular/034-aia-live-from-ng-conf-2015), where the guys discuss the conference and it definitely got me excited.

    I also listened to the [Angular Air episode 6](https://plus.google.com/events/cmhq7mqarkoful8u7iusbjsdjtk) with the ionic team. They talk about their excitement for Angular 2 and how they are working closely with the angular team while working on Ionic 2. As someone who loves to use Ionic, I'm super excited to see what it's next version has in store. Check out this [blog post](http://ionicframework.com/blog/angular-2-ionic/) from the [Ionic blog](http://ionicframework.com/blog/) that goes into more detail on Angular 2 and Ionic 2.

    Angular 2 definitely looks like it packs some changes and I have to take a deeper look before commenting on them. On the surface it looks like it has some serious preformance improvements which I'm always down for. I do like the idea that Angular 2.0 will embrace ES6 and web components. I think this is great for the future of web and for pushing standards. I've started using customer elements (one part of the web component spec) at my job and it helped me solve a unique problem with some ease and elegance. I'm definitely excited to check out and start using Angular 2.

#### Road Map
Here are a few things I'm planning on adding to this repo.

- A 'Where to start' guide
    + I have had many questions directed my way in the form of "All of these frameworks and technologies are great, but where do I start?"
    + I would like this section to help guide developers that may be new to some of this stuff, down the right path to "connecting the dots"
    + I will explain how some of the ["Things to check out"](#things-to-check-out-no-particular-order) can be used to create an actual application.
- An tutorial section specifically for beginners
    + Sometimes its tough to find the right tutorials to jump in to a new library or framework.
    + I plan on adding links to tutorials guided towards developers trying out a libarary or framework for the first time.
